// Only some of the variants maintained in https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/variants
// have the correct pinout for an ESP-WROOM-02. To keep the code generic,
// we define our own constants. In the Arduino IDE, just choose "ESP8266 Generic".
#define I2C_SDA_PIN 2   // this is GPIO2, on physical pin 7
#define I2C_SCK_PIN 14  // this is GPIO14, on physical pin 3
